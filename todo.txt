clothing recommendation - get clothing by certain quality



- restrict image access to only users who own the clothing
-> by changing name of clothing image to userpk + underbar +clothingpk?
-> look into presigned url (https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-samples/latest/catalog/python-s3-generate_presigned_url.py.html
-> look into endpoint (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html)
-> specifying bucket policy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-2)

- clothing edit still requires owner as a field
- check for ownership for when deleting, updating, getting list of users
- automatically set "owner" filed for when uploading clothing from token, instead of accepting owner as a field
- restict get clothing access to owners (get owner not from owner field, but from token)

- add python-decouple to requirements.txt
