delete post image model?

right now the weather apis are updating things like city indexes that don't really need to change,
maybe cut down on this to preserve number of database writes?

delete weather, testapp apps, use weatherapi app as default from now on


- restrict image access to only users who own the clothing
-> by changing name of clothing image to userpk + underbar +clothingpk?
-> look into presigned url (https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-samples/latest/catalog/python-s3-generate_presigned_url.py.html
-> look into endpoint (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html)
-> specifying bucket policy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-2)

- clothing edit still requires owner as a field
- check for ownership for when deleting, updating, getting list of users
- automatically set "owner" filed for when uploading clothing from token, instead of accepting owner as a field
- restict get clothing access to owners (get owner not from owner field, but from token)
